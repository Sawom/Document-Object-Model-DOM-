            I kept looking as my heart followed you, <br>
            There's something between us that has been unsaid, <br>
            What I've never said I'm saying it for the first time. <br>
            You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you, <br>
            You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you <br>
            It's due to the conspiracy of love that we've met again <br>

            I'm a crazy traveller and my legs don't stop anywhere <br>

            No one wants freedom from the jail of love <br>

            All these seasons were colourless and dull without you <br>
            All the moments that you were not a part of were useless <br>
            The life that I'm living is nothing without you <br>
